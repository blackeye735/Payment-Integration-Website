# Payment-Integration-Website
I am currently pursuing an internship from The Sparks Foundation in Web Development and I have been asked to deliver a Responsive **Payment Gateway Integration Website**. I have done it using HTML, CSS and a little bit of Javascript. Also the payment interface is Razorpay and the responses are sent to email via PHP.<br>
**Website URL**:- ***https://blackeye735.github.io/Payment-Integration-Website***

Everyone is requested to visit the website, suggest me for possible changes and improvements to make the website much much better.....and do star the repository.

Made with LOVE by **blackeye735**!!!<br>
Cheers!!!
