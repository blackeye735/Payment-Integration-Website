# Payment-Integration-Website
I am currently pursuing an internship from The Sparks Foundation in Web Development and I have been asked to deliver a Responsive Payment Integration Website. I have done it using HTML, CSS and a little bit of Javascript. Also the payment interface is Razorpay and the responses are sent to email via PHP.
